## Last Week's Accomplishments

Tested LSTM generator for the first time! Gave incorrect outputs "*" lots of stars, so I'll have to fix that. 

## This Week's Plan

Remove the misselamous text from wonderland.txt and re-run the LSTMs to get new weights.

## Anything Blocking?

I have a test this week :(.
